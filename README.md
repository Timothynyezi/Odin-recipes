In this project I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
This project will demonstrate the skills that I have learned, and acquired while learning the foundations of html.
The skills enlisted are as follows:
- Creating a webpage using html.
- Using htm elements, tags and the (!) boilerplate filler to structre the html file.These elements include, head,DOCTYPE, meta,title,body, and heading, paragraphs, images within the body element.
- Adding links(absolute and relative) in the landing page to access other pages in the current page, and other pages in different websites on the internet.
- Adding images to pages in a correct fie path.
- File management.
